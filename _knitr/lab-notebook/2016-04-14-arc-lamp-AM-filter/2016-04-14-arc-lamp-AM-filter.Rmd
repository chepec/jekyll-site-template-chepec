## Methods

I measured the power from the arc lamp at distances of $\SIrange{30}{60}{\cm}$, using a Thorlabs PM160T power meter.


The power meter's sensor is circular, with a diameter of $\SI{10}{\mm}$ according to the manual.


```{r}
sensor.diameter <- 1.0 # cm
sensor.area <- pi * (0.5 * sensor.diameter)^2
area.corr.factor <- 1 / sensor.area
```

The sensor area is $\SI{`r formatC(sensor.area)`}{\square\cm}$, and consequently we need to multiply the values we read out with a factor `r formatC(area.corr.factor)` to get proper power densities.

The arc lamp housing is a Newport (Oriel instruments) model 67005, mfd. 2009-07, for lamp power 50--500W.  The tube of the lamp housing is fitted with an AM1.5 filter.
The housing contains an Xr arc lamp.

The arc lamp power supply is a Newport 69911, set to supply $\SI{200}{\watt}$.

## Data (results)

```{r}
power <- read.csv(file = "distance-vs-power.csv")
power$corr.distance <- power$distance - 3.5 # cm
power$density <- round(power$power * area.corr.factor)
```

The units of the density values are $\si{\milli\watt\per\square\cm}$.

```{r}
# note: lm(log()) and lm(log10()) give very similar results,
# essentially indistinguishable visually
# we'll just use the natural logarithm
# xvec: pad the experimental distance range enough so the model
# reaches zero power to the right and the y-axis to the left
xvec <-
   c(seq(1, 26),
     power$corr.distance,
     seq(57, 63))
fit <-
   lm(density ~ logb(corr.distance, base = exp(1)),
      data = power)
power.predicted.log <-
   predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(corr.distance = xvec))
power.calc <-
   data.frame(distance = xvec,
              density.log = power.predicted.log)
```


```{r lnb-160414-arclamp-powerdensity, echo=FALSE}
p.data <-
   ggplot(power) +
   geom_point(aes(x = corr.distance, y = density)) +
   geom_line(aes(x = corr.distance, y = density)) +
   labs(x = "Distance/cm",
        y = expression("Power density/mW" ~ cm^{-2}))
p.model <-
   ggplot() +
   geom_line(data = power.calc,
             colour = "blue",
             size = 0.5,
             aes(x = distance,
                 y = density.log)) +
   geom_point(data = power,
              aes(x = corr.distance, y = density)) +
   scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, by = 200),
                      labels = paste(seq(0, 1200, by = 200))) +
   labs(x = "Distance/cm",
        y = expression("Power density/mW" ~ cm^{-2}))
p.diff <-
   ggplot(fit, aes(.fitted, .resid)) +
   geom_line(size = 0.5,
             colour = "blue") +
   geom_point(colour = "blue") +
   labs(x = expression("Power density/mW" ~ cm^{-2}),
        y = expression("Residual"))
vp.data <-
   viewport(width = 0.5, height = 1, x = 0, y = 0, just = c("left", "bottom"))
vp.model <-
   viewport(width = 0.5, height = 0.67, x = 0.5, y = 0.33, just = c("left", "bottom"))
vp.diff <-
   viewport(width = 0.5, height = 0.33, x = 0.5, y = 0, just = c("left", "bottom"))
print(p.data, vp = vp.data)
print(p.model, vp = vp.model)
print(p.diff, vp = vp.diff)
```

Note that the fitted model (an exponential) grows asymptotically as $x \rightarrow 0$.

```{r}
# attempting to use fitted model to calculate any power density
# the parameters of the fit
# y = a * exp(mx), where a is y-intercept, and m is slope
# y <- fit$coefficients[1] * exp(fit$coefficients[2] * xvec)
# (not correct, I'm still missing something)
```


The 1 Sun equivalent output ($\SI{100}{\mW\per\square\cm}$) is achieved at $\SI{42}{\cm}$ from the lamp (measured from the tip of the tube, as by previous workers).

The total power of the light drops exponentially with distance, as expected, which is confirmed by the good agreement between the fitted exponential (blue line) and the data points. The lower-right panel shows the residual (difference) between the exponential fit and the data.




## Remarks

The total power output of the lamp has clearly diminished since it was installed in 2009 or 2010. The last documented measure of the 1-Sun distance was in 2010 and put it at $\SI{59.3}{\cm}$.
